# Reddi Azure Scripts
Azure scripts that I've used in past, that may be useful to others

# Script 1 - New Azure VM
NewAzureVM.ps1 creates a new Azure VM based on one of the multiple templates available. While there are more repetitive ways using JSON files to manage configuration, I've found this script useful when I just wanted to get up and running in experimentation mode with a new VM. Simpy run:

``` New-ReddiAzureVM.ps1 ```

and follow the command-line wizard prompts.
